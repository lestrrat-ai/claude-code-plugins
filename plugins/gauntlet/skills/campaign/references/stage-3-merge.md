## Stage 3 — Merge (serialized, auto)

A PR is mergeable when the **current** `git rev-parse HEAD` equals `head_sha` AND
`reviews_ok >= required(tier)` AND `ci == green` — i.e. `required(tier)` SATISFIED verdicts
(1 if `tier == TRIVIAL`, else 2) and green CI all recorded against the live tip.

1. **Serialize merge operations, not wakes.** A wake may merge multiple PRs, but only one at a time.
   Before each merge, re-confirm both gates still hold for the current HEAD (a late push may have
   reset them), **and re-fetch `origin/<base>` and re-check
   `gh pr view <pr> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`** — a concurrent run sharing this base may
   have advanced it since the PR was last reviewed. If it now reads `BEHIND`/`DIRTY`/`CONFLICTING`,
   refresh the PR per step 6 instead of merging it.
2. Push guard: `gh pr view <branch> --json state --jq .state` must be `OPEN`.
3. Merge: `gh pr merge <pr> --squash --delete-branch` (use the repo's prevailing merge method if not
   squash).
4. **Sync the local base branch with the remote.** The merge landed on `origin/<base>`, but local
   `<base>` is now behind. Fast-forward it so every subsequent rebase and `<base>...HEAD` diff is
   measured against the just-merged tip, not a stale one (`<base>` = the adopted PRs' `baseRefName`,
   not assumed `main`).
   Local `<base>` is **shared** with any concurrent run on the same base; the fast-forward is
   idempotent, so if another run already advanced it, a no-op "already up to date" is fine — just never
   force it.

   **Run the fast-forward from wherever `<base>` is actually checked out** — don't assume it's the
   root checkout. A branch can be checked out in at most one working tree, so first locate that tree
   (`git worktree list` shows the branch per path; the root package counts as one), then fast-forward
   there. If `<base>` is checked out **nowhere**, update the ref directly instead — a plain `fetch`
   into the local branch (this form is refused while the branch is checked out, which is why it's the
   no-working-tree case):

   ```
   git -C $PROJECT fetch origin <base>
   # case A — <base> is checked out in some working tree <dir> (root or a worktree):
   git -C <dir> merge --ff-only origin/<base>
   # case B — <base> is checked out in no working tree:
   git -C $PROJECT fetch origin <base>:<base>
   ```

   Fast-forward only — never a merge commit or reset. If the fast-forward fails (local `<base>` somehow
   diverged), do NOT force it: that's a bailout condition (stop and surface it), since rebasing PRs
   onto a wrong base would corrupt every downstream diff.
5. **Clean up on successful merge.** Once the merge is confirmed (`gh pr view <branch> --json state
   --jq .state` → `MERGED`), tear down that PR's local footprint. `<branch>` and its worktree are the
   adopted PR's **own head branch** and the worktree named for it, exactly as recorded in that PR's
   ledger row (its `branch`/`worktree` columns) — there is no `fix-<run-id>-*` branch to clean up:
   - `--delete-branch` above already removed the **remote** branch (the PR's own head branch).
   - Verify the merge with the `git-detect-merged` skill, then use `git-cleanup-merged` to remove the
     **ledger-recorded worktree** and delete the **ledger-recorded local branch** (the PR's own head
     branch).
   - Set status `merged` and stop its background tasks.

   This runs only after the merge is verified, and only ever touches PRs this run **owns** — those
   carrying its `gauntlet-run-<run-id>` label — never another run's. Leave the worktree in place if the
   merge cannot be confirmed — treat that as a bailout condition, not a cleanup.
6. After each merge+sync+cleanup, reconcile other open PRs. **Base advancement alone does NOT
   invalidate gauntlet reviews.** Rebase only if GitHub flags the PR behind/conflicting:
   - Clean rebase (no conflicts) → verify the PR's own diff/content is unchanged → keep `reviews_ok`,
     update `head_sha` to the new tip, set `ci = pending`, **and relaunch its CI watch in the same
     wake** — the rebased PR must not sit unwatched until the heartbeat; CI must return green before
     merging.
   - Rebase requiring conflict resolution → PR content changed → **reset `reviews_ok` to 0**, relaunch
     the CI watch, re-enter Stage 2.
   - Still open, mergeable, not behind/dirty/conflicting, same live `head_sha`,
     `reviews_ok >= required(tier)`, and `ci == green` → still immediately mergeable; return to step 1
     in the same wake.

Stop the merge loop only when no remaining PR is immediately mergeable after the latest base refresh.
