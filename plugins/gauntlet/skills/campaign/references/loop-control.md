## Loop control

> **Read when:** every heartbeat executes these steps in order; jump to the step you are in.

The skill is **event-driven**. Read `runtime-adapter.md` before waiting. Reconciles come from the first
invocation, a scheduled heartbeat when the host provides one, a **background task completing**, or the
bounded-wait fallback returning. A completion may be a CI watch, a review, or a CI/review fix.

**Every heartbeat — reconcile, dispatch, reschedule:**

### Step 1 — Resolve repository context, then the run + lease, then init / resume / start fresh

1. **Resolve repository context, then the run + lease, then init / resume / start fresh.** Call
   `runtime-adapter.md`'s repository-context resolver exactly once with the supplied checkout and carry
   that record for every path and Git cwd on this heartbeat. Then bind **which run this heartbeat is
   for** and confirm you may drive it — `run-identity-and-lease.md`, "Resolving a heartbeat", owns the
   whole resolution: which arg mode does what, and which `lease.py` call to present a token to. Drive
   only on an `owned`/`adopted` verdict; on `superseded` or any refusal, **stand down**.
   This lease gate is what guarantees **no two agents drive one ledger**.

   Once bound and confirmed owner, decide on **liveness of THIS run**, not on whether some `state.jsonl`
   exists — and scope **every** git/gh scan to this run's `gauntlet-run-<run-id>` label so another run's
   PRs are never mistaken for your own (adopted PRs keep their OWN head branch, so ownership is the
   LABEL only — never a branch prefix). Live work (this run) = any open PR carrying this run's label,
   **OR** any non-terminal row in this run's `state.jsonl` (`in_review` / `awaiting-api` /
   `awaiting-user`).
   Three cases:

   - **This run has live work → resume.** A dead review pass — no verdict, no live task — is resolved by
     its relaunch budget alone (highest-numbered `launch_attempt`: `1` → relaunch once as attempt `2`;
     `2` → **fresh-worker fallback**), **NOT by a blind re-launch**; the full algorithm and why launch
     evidence is irrelevant on this path live in **"Resume after a killed session"** below (Stage 2a).
     **Reconcile against ground truth** — do NOT redo *completed* work; a CI task whose output file is
     missing may be re-launched, since in-flight tasks die with their session — then, for each of this
     run's branches/PRs read the live SHA, CI status, and verdict files, and refresh the ledger: write
     every ledger update through `scripts/ledger.py … set/header set` **by field name**
     (`files-and-ledger.md`), never by hand-editing rows by column position.

     **This refresh is itself a gate-reset site — relabel here, in this step.** When it detects that a
     PR's live `head_sha` has moved with the PR diff changed (a formatter/bot commit, a manual push,
     any content change this run did not dispatch), it resets `reviews_ok` to 0 — and MUST, in the same
     step, relabel a PR carrying `gauntlet-accepted` back to `gauntlet-reviewing`
     (`stage-2-review-gate.md`, "Status labels mirror the review gate").
     Do NOT defer this to the label-reconcile pass below — that pass is only the **backstop** ("This
     reconcile is a backstop, not the mechanism", below). (A clean base-only advance with the PR
     diff unchanged does not reset the gate, so it keeps `gauntlet-accepted`.)

     **And whenever this refresh writes a NEW `head_sha` — gate reset or not — RESET THE LIVENESS
     COUNTERS** (`stage-2-ci.md`, "THE LIVENESS COUNTERS", which owns why), in the same `ledger.py … set`
     call. This covers **both** cases above: the content change that resets the gate, **and** the clean
     base-only advance that does not. **NAME the set; do NOT unpack it here** — a gloss that lists the
     set's members is a **restatement** that goes stale the moment the set gains a member (this line's
     did, when `ci_stalled_since` joined).

     Do the PR scan as
     **one batched snapshot per heartbeat** — the **same canonical command** `pr-adoption.md` runs, writing the
     **same path with the same schema** (they are the same scan; two spellings of it is how a reader of
     `prs.json` ends up with fields that are not there, or a snapshot scoped to the wrong PRs). Its owning
     definition is the block **"The canonical `prs.json` command"** in `files-and-ledger.md`; copy it
     whole, never a variant:

     ```text
     run_argv(
       argv: ["gh", "pr", "list", "--label", concat("gauntlet-run-", run_id),
              "--state", "open", "--limit", "1000",
              "--json", "number,headRefName,headRefOid,title,baseRefName,state,mergeable,mergeStateStatus,labels"],
       cwd: repository.project_root,
       stdin_file: null,
       stdout_file: path_join(<rundir>, "prs.json")
     )
     ```

     — and drive reconcile from that file; fall back to per-PR `gh pr view` only where the snapshot
     isn't enough (merge-gate CI truth stays the SHA-pinned, SHA-verified snapshot of **both** check
     families, Stage 2b). Heartbeat
     turnaround is throughput: every serial `gh` call in reconcile delays every dispatch behind it. Re-read
     **the ledger header's run config — EVERY field of it, whatever they are** (`files-and-ledger.md` owns
     that set; do NOT keep a copy of it here, a list beside a property goes stale the heartbeat a field is
     added). It governs the run, and must be
     consulted fresh each heartbeat, never from memory (a heartbeat may be a fresh agent instance that just
     adopted the run, so an explicit/preferred reviewer would otherwise
     be lost and silently revert to the default; Constraints, Base branch, "The reviewer",
     "PR adoption"). Refresh
     the lease. This is the path every `--run` scheduled heartbeat takes.
   - **No run bound and none live (no `gauntlet-run-*` PR, no non-terminal `<rundir>`) → first run.**
     **Check there is something to adopt BEFORE creating any run state.** If the invocation carries no
     `#PR` args (a bare or non-`#PR` invocation that found no live run to resume — likewise `--new`
     with no `#PR` args), **create nothing** — no run-id, no `<rundir>`, no lease, no `state.jsonl` — and
     show the **idle prompt** (`run-identity-and-lease.md`, "Resolving a heartbeat", owns its wording).
     Creating `<rundir>`/lease/header before a PR is confirmed would leave an empty
     orphan run that later no-arg invocations rediscover as bogus state.

     When there **are** `#PR` args, **preflight the whole set FIRST — read-only, before creating any
     run state**: read every PR's metadata (`gh pr view`), run the refusal checks (foreign-owned,
     cross-repo/fork per `pr-adoption.md`), and verify all share a common `baseRefName`. This touches
     **no** run-id, `<rundir>`, lease, `state.jsonl`, label, worktree, or CI watch. **If the bases
     disagree or any PR is refused, prompt and create nothing** — so a rejected set never leaves an
     empty orphan run behind. **Only once the full set passes preflight**: call `create_run_directory`
     **first** — it mints the run-id and atomically creates `<rundir>` — and derive `run_id` from the
     returned directory's final path component; **then** take the run per `run-identity-and-lease.md`,
     "Take a run" (token, heartbeat arming, `lease.py acquire` — in that order),
     and write the `state.jsonl` header — now with `run_id` set and `base_branch` filled
     from the agreed `baseRefName` (known from preflight). Then **adopt** each PR
     (ledger row + labels + worktree, and a CI watch **only when one is due** — `pr-adoption.md` owns what
     adoption produces and when the watch is warranted); a death mid-adoption still leaves
     a discoverable, adoptable run. Then fall through to dispatch/reschedule.
   - **This run's `state.jsonl` is fully terminal — every row `merged`/`aborted`, no open PR carrying this
     run's label → the run is finished.** Do **not** silently exit "all fixed" (the old bug) and do **not**
     silently restart. **Ask the user** whether to gate more PRs — e.g. "gauntlet run
     <run-id> finished (N merged, M aborted). Gate more PRs? Pass PR numbers (or run gauntlet:review
     first)." A new run needs a `#PR` set, so collect PR numbers (equivalently direct the user to
     `<campaign-invocation> --new #PR...`); on a PR set, start a fresh run **with carryover** (see "Fresh
     runs and carryover") — **no run-id/lease/`state.jsonl` is created until that set passes preflight**.
     With no PR numbers (or "no"), emit that run's final report and stop. This prompt is the *only* heartbeat
     that asks the user about scope.

   **The `--new` fresh-run signal short-circuits the above — but only WITH `#PR` args:** `--new #PR...`
   (or "fresh run" / "start over" with PR numbers) mints a NEW run-id + token and starts a fresh run
   adopting those PRs immediately, regardless of any run's liveness — no prompt, and **other live runs
   are left untouched** (they keep running under
   their own drivers). **`--new` with no `#PR` args creates nothing** — it falls through to the idle
   prompt (run `gauntlet:review`, or pass PR numbers), exactly like a bare no-arg first run, and mints
   no run-id/`<rundir>`/lease.

   **Reconcile labels too** (idempotent, retroactive, **scoped to this run**). Ensure the labels exist
   (`gh label create … --force`, including this run's `gauntlet-run-<run-id>`), then for every PR **of
   this run** (its `gauntlet-run-<run-id>` label — the only ownership marker for adopted PRs): ensure
   it carries `gauntlet-run-<run-id>`, and **overwrite** its status label to match its **live** gate
   state. **Never touch another run's PRs.**

   **Always apply one status label AND remove the other — never merely add.** The two status labels are
   mutually exclusive, so a purely additive reconcile cannot repair the one state it most needs to: a
   PR wearing **both** labels (what a missed swap at a reset site actually produces) would keep the
   contradictory label forever, because adding a label it already carries changes nothing. Write it
   unconditionally, in one call per PR, so the outcome does not depend on which labels are already there:

   ```
   # current HEAD holds required(tier) SATISFIED verdicts:
   gh pr edit <pr> --add-label gauntlet-accepted  --remove-label gauntlet-reviewing
   # otherwise:
   gh pr edit <pr> --add-label gauntlet-reviewing --remove-label gauntlet-accepted
   ```

   Both forms are idempotent (`--add-label` of a label already present and `--remove-label` of one that
   is absent are both no-ops), so this converges from **any** starting state — neither label, one label,
   the wrong label, or both.

   This reconcile is a **backstop, not the mechanism**. The relabel is owed at the moment the gate
   resets, in the same step that writes `reviews_ok = 0` (`stage-2-review-gate.md`, "Status labels
   mirror the review gate"); this pass only *self-heals* a swap that was somehow missed. A PR that
   reaches this point wearing a stale `gauntlet-accepted` — or both labels at once — means some reset
   site skipped its relabel: fix the label here, and treat it as a bug in that site, not as normal
   operation.

   **Settle the base branch's required-check set before any CI derivation:** run `scripts/ci-status.py
   required-set --ledger <rundir>/state.jsonl`. Run it every heartbeat; the command reuses a settled value and
   only retries `unknown`. `stage-2-ci.md`, "WHAT WERE WE EXPECTING TO SEE?", owns its states and behavior.
### Step 2 — Fold in completions

2. **Fold in completions.** For any background task that finished (CI watch → **a HEARTBEAT, not an artifact**:
   the watch only blocks and produces nothing, so this heartbeat performs the SHA-pinned fetch of
   both check families, promotes it atomically to `ci-<pr>-<head_sha>.txt` and verifies its stamp
   against the ledger's current `head_sha` before parsing a single line of it — the CI state is
   never decided from the watch's exit code (Stage 2b, "WHO DOES WHAT" and "VERIFY THE STAMP BEFORE
   PARSING"); review →
   the active launch attempt's output file, with its progress file as liveness evidence — attempt 1
   uses `.prompt.txt` and writes `review-<pr>-<n>.txt` / `.progress.jsonl` / `.findings.jsonl`; a
   relaunch uses and writes `review-<pr>-<n>.a<k>.*`, and
   only the attempt named in the current `pass_identity` is read or counted (Stage 2a). **Before a
   review verdict is counted, the pass's artifacts must verify** — `scripts/review-pass.py verify --verdict
   <what the report's VERDICT line says>`, never
   an ad-hoc parse; anything but `ok` means the verdict is not tallied (Stage 2a, "Does this pass COUNT?").
   **`--verdict` is REQUIRED** — it is what lets the tool check the one rule it can, so a COMPLETE pass
   verified without it is `unusable`, never `ok` (a rule a driver can switch off by forgetting a flag is
   not a gate). That rule is an if and only if: `not-satisfied` exactly when at least one GATING
   finding stands — a verdict that blocks a PR
   must name what blocks it, and a finding that blocks a PR cannot be waved through by the verdict. Either
   way round is `unusable` (Stage 2a, "Does this pass COUNT?").
   **A pass that raised a separate request instead of ruling passes `verify --verdict deferred`** (the
   report's terminal line is `VERDICT: DEFERRED`, or the progress file holds an unruled
   `plan_amendment_request`): `deferred` is not a verdict, so it is never tallied — the tool routes on
   the progress file and returns `amended` (fold the amendment, re-run the pass) or `incomplete`
   (relaunch), and only a binary `satisfied`/`not-satisfied` ever reaches the ledger below.
   **Then record the verdict with `scripts/ledger.py verdict --pr <N> --head-sha <sha> --verdict …`** — the
   ONLY sanctioned path, and the only thing that bumps `review_rounds` (Stage 2a, "Recording a verdict");
   never set `reviews_ok` by hand.
   For any completed task (review, CI watch,
   CI/review fix), record the result against the SHA it ran on and act per Stage 2.
### Step 3 — Dispatch due work

3. **Dispatch due work — non-blocking, idempotent, bounded, work-conserving.** Scan the whole run,
   not just the PR/job that woke you. Launch every due action that fits a free slot before returning.
   Launch only what is actually due *and not already in flight* (check ground truth first, never the
   ledger alone).

   #### HELD-STATUS GUARD — a PROPERTY, not a list, and now a COMMAND

   **HELD-STATUS GUARD — a PROPERTY, not a list, and now a COMMAND. Apply it BEFORE every bullet below,
   and before every other action this skill takes on a PR.** While a PR's `status` is **HELD** the PR is
   **FROZEN: take NO action that MUTATES it.** **Skip it and keep driving the run's other PRs** — the run
   stays live and a held PR NEVER blocks the loop (`run-identity-and-lease.md`, "Never hold the run hostage
   on a user prompt").

   **Ask the tool, never a memorized list:**

   ```
   ledger.py --file <state.jsonl> dispatch-check --pr <N>     # non-zero => do NOT act on this PR
   ```

   `HELD_STATUSES` in `scripts/ledger.py` is the **one place** the members are enumerated, and
   `files-and-ledger.md`, `status`, is their definition. **Never retype that list here or anywhere else** —
   a status added to it must be enforced at every site with no edit to any of them. Today it holds two
   kinds, held for **different reasons** and cleared by **different events**:

   - **PARKED** (`awaiting-user`, `awaiting-api`) — waiting on a **HUMAN**. No amount of machine work can
     resolve it; only the user's answer unparks it (below).
   - **`repairing`** — the PR reached a **review-loop cap** and has stopped converging. It is **NOT waiting
     on a human**: campaign clears it **itself**, by running the reassessment pass and executing the one
     decision that comes back (`repair-pass.md`). **A cap is a mode switch, not a doorbell — do NOT prompt
     the user.** Ordinary gate work is refused for it; the **decided repair** is the one thing that may be
     dispatched, and only once the decision is recorded (`dispatch-check --action repair`).

   **The test is "does this MUTATE the PR?" — NOT "is this action named in a list?"** *Mutate* = change
   the PR or dispatch work that will: its content, its head commit, its base, its labels, its
   open/merged state. Non-exhaustively: no review pass, no CI fix, no review fix, no copilot-address, no
   precondition fix, no merge, no base refresh, no rebase (clean **or** conflict-resolving), no push, no
   relabel, no gate reset, no content change of any kind — **and nothing absent from this list either.**
   The list is **illustrative; the property governs.** An enumeration of dispatch sites WILL miss one —
   it already did: this guard once listed four (review, CI fix, review fix, merge) and missed
   `stage-3-merge.md` step 6, whose post-merge rebase of PRs that fell behind would have moved a held
   PR's `head_sha`, reset its gate, and **changed the very PR content the user was parked to
   adjudicate**. Any site the skill grows later is covered the moment it would mutate a held PR, with
   no edit to this list. When unsure whether an action mutates, treat it as mutating and skip it.
   - **The ONE exception is the CI watch: OBSERVING a PR is not mutating it.** The park **does not change
     the watch either way** — it follows the normal policy, `stage-2-ci.md`, "WATCH ONLY WHAT CAN MOVE":
     alive while an evidence row can still `RUN`, **not** relaunched once CI has SETTLED (relaunching a
     settled PR's watch burns a heartbeat per second and observes nothing). Parking never stops a warranted
     watch and never starts an unwarranted one. But do **NOT** dispatch a CI *fix*.
   - **Recording ground truth is not mutating either.** Reconcile still READS a parked PR (live SHA, CI,
     labels) and writes what it read to the ledger — including a `reviews_ok` reset, and its label
     mirror, when **someone else** pushed to the PR (step 1). Recording a change campaign did not make is
     not making one. What is frozen is **campaign's own action on the PR**; a park never licenses a
     lying label or a stale row.

   #### Only the user's answer unparks a PR

   - **Only the user's answer unparks a PR — and EVERY park class names the durable record it is
     answered into.** An answer that lives only in this session is an answer a fresh agent re-asks. On
     the answer: **record it**, then unpark to the `status` **THAT ANSWER** dictates — the table below is
     the authority, and it is **NOT always `in_review`**:
     - a **RESUME** answer (`api_approval` = `approved`, a standoff ruling either way, `blocker_ruling` =
       `retry`) → `ledger.py … set --pr <N> --status in_review`, and resume normal dispatch — including any
       rebase or base refresh the PR has been owed while frozen — from the next heartbeat. A parked PR that has
       fallen **behind** its base simply **stays behind** until then; it is not dropped from the run, just
       frozen.
     - a **TERMINAL** answer (`api_approval` = `declined`, `blocker_ruling` = `abort`) → `--status aborted`
       (terminal), via `bailout-and-final-report.md`'s abort procedure. It **never** returns to
       `in_review`, and nothing is dispatched for it again.

     The record and the unpark, per cause (`files-and-ledger.md`, `status`):

     | Park cause | Durable record | Unpark |
     |---|---|---|
     | **`awaiting-api`** — an API-changing fix | `api_approval` = `approved@<iso>` / `declined@<iso>` | `approved` → `in_review`; `declined` → terminal `aborted` |
     | **`awaiting-user`, review standoff** — a REFUTED finding the fresh reviewer re-raised | the ruling in `<rundir>/audit-<pr>-<n>.md` | `in_review`; ruled **valid** → the finding is fixed like a CONFIRMED one, ruled **invalid** → normal flow |
     | **`awaiting-user`, machine blocker** — campaign cannot move this PR without a human; that **property** IS the class, **never a list of cases** (one illustration: CI has SETTLED and is still not green). Do not enumerate the members here — `files-and-ledger.md`, `status`, `awaiting-user` class 2, **owns** the class, and `ci_reason` names the blocker at every one of them, present or future | `blocker_ruling` = `retry@<iso>` / `abort@<iso>` | `retry` → `in_review`, **RESET THE LIVENESS COUNTERS**, and **SPEND the ruling: `blocker_ruling` = `-`** (`stage-2-ci.md`, "THE LIVENESS COUNTERS" / "THE RULING IS CONSUMED EXACTLY ONCE"), then re-derive CI on the next heartbeat; `abort` → terminal `aborted` (the ruling **stays** — it is the record of why) |

     **The counter reset is part of the unpark, not an optimization**: a `retry` that clears nothing
     re-escalates on its first derivation (`stage-2-ci.md`, "THE LIVENESS COUNTERS" / "SETTLED" /
     "UNUSABLE — the refetch is BOUNDED", own why). The loop is bounded by the **human**: campaign never
     re-asks unprompted, and every park is a fresh question backed by a fresh snapshot.

     **A `retry` is SPENT when it is consumed — one ruling answers exactly ONE park.** Write `status =
     in_review`, the counter reset, and `blocker_ruling` = `-` in the **same** `ledger.py … set --pr <N>`
     call. That re-park above is precisely the case that proves it: the PR comes back to the **same**
     machine blocker, and a ruling left on the row would answer the new park with the **old** answer —
     the blocker would silently self-clear with no fresh user answer, which is the one thing the durable
     record exists to prevent. Park **entry** clears it too (`stage-2-ci.md`, ESCALATE), so a crash
     between the unpark and the next park cannot resurrect a spent ruling; the two clears are belt and
     braces on the same invariant, and the entry clear is the one that survives a lost context.
     **`abort` is different and is NOT cleared:** it goes **terminal** (`aborted`), and a terminal row is
     never re-parked, so nothing can ever re-consume it.
   - **Why the guard must live HERE, at the dispatch site:** `reviews_ok < required(tier)` is TRUE for a
     parked PR (the park does not raise it), so a dispatch rule that looks only at `reviews_ok` will
     happily re-review a PR that is waiting on a human — and a `SATISFIED` verdict would then make it
     eligible to merge and **merge it WITHOUT the user's ruling**, which is exactly the hole the standoff
     park exists to close. **The park MUST be enforced wherever the PR is ACTED ON — every dispatch site
     and every mutation site — not merely recorded in the ledger.**

   **A `repairing` PR is the ONE held PR that still has machine work due — and it is NOT the work the
   other bullets describe.** Do not skip it and do not prompt the user; drive its repair to completion:

   - **no `repair_decision` yet** → dispatch the **reassessment pass** (`repair-pass.md`): a
     context-isolated worker in the **`session`** class, handed **every round's verdict and finding, the
     diff-growth curve, the intent artifact, and the current diff — all at once**. No heartbeat has ever had
     that view; it is why 21 rounds passed unnoticed. It returns ONE decision from a closed enum, recorded
     with `repair-pass.py decide` (which refuses a decision this PR may not take — see the ownership
     guardrail).
   - **a `repair_decision` is recorded** → `ledger.py dispatch-check --pr <N> --action repair`, then
     execute **that** decision and no other work. When the repair has landed, return the row to the gate
     (`ledger.py … set --pr <N> --status in_review`). `review_rounds` is **not** reset — it never is.
   - **`repair_decision` is `abort@…`** → the row is already terminal (`aborted`): run the abort procedure
     (`bailout-and-final-report.md`) — leave the PR **OPEN**, drop this run's labels, write `abort-<id>.md`.

   Then, for each PR that is **not held at all**:
   - any newly-adopted PR whose ledger row lacks a `tier`, or any PR whose `head_sha` changed since it
     was last triaged → **re-triage its tier** (deterministic file-class classification of the changed
     files at that `head_sha`; agent-docs = code; default STANDARD on uncertainty — see the tiers
     spec) and write it back with `ledger.py … set --pr <N> --tier <tier>`. The tier is pinned to
     `head_sha` and sets `required(tier)` = **1 if TRIVIAL else 2**.
   - current tip has `reviews_ok < required(tier)`, its **review preconditions are clear** (no
     unaddressed Copilot review items, CI not red, no merge conflict with `<base>` — see Stage 2a
     preconditions), and no review running for that SHA → **first ensure the PR's INTENT
     (`<rundir>/intent-<pr>.md`) and PR-head worktree exist.** The dispatch substitutes the intent block
     into the review prompt **verbatim** (`review-dispatch.md`), and a reviewer with no intent is a
     reviewer asked "is anything wrong with this code?" — the question with no fixed point. **It is not an
     exhortation: `review-pass.py verify` loads `intent-<pr>.md` for EVERY pass, so a pass dispatched
     without one is `unusable` and its verdict cannot be tallied** — the review would be spent for nothing.
     If the file is
     missing (a wiped `<rundir>`), write it **per `pr-adoption.md` step 3a** and record its provenance in
     the row's `intent`. Then **ensure the PR-head worktree exists**
     (the reviewer receives `<worktree>` as explicit review input under the transport-specific isolation
     contract in `runtime-adapter.md` — the
     PR row's ledger `worktree` column value, the
     single source of truth for this PR's checkout path (created at adoption/pre-review per
     `pr-adoption.md`; the ledger-recorded `<worktree>` path from that repository-context-aware
     operation) — and diffs
     `origin/<base>...HEAD`, so a real checkout must be present): if that `<worktree>` is missing, create it
     from the PR head **per `pr-adoption.md` step 5** — which reuses an existing checkout of that branch
     if one exists (root or another worktree), else adds a fresh worktree, since `git worktree add`
     refuses a branch checked out elsewhere — and record its path in the row's `worktree`. This is an
     explicit precondition of the review launch. **Also fetch `origin/<base>` fresh before the first
     review dispatch through the typed Stage 2a pre-review operation** — the review
     diffs `origin/<base>...HEAD`, a remote-tracking ref that always exists, since adoption fetches only
     the PR head and a local `<base>` may be absent or stale (see `pr-adoption.md` / Stage 2a). Then
     evaluate the verdict transport through `runtime-adapter.md`'s capability/transition owner before
     building its record and take only the action it returns;
     missing native cwd/mount/sandbox controls alone are not a machine blocker. Then launch **one**
     review pass as a **background**
     task (one at a time per PR — the second, when the tier requires two, only after the first is
     SATISFIED; Stage 2a). If a precondition is dirty, clear it first (address Copilot items / fix CI /
     rebase) instead of spending a review;
   - a review pass is in flight but the **active attempt's** progress file holds **no launch evidence**
     — no reviewer-written line of ANY kind after `pass_identity` (a `progress` `started`/`done` event
     *or* a `plan_amendment_request` all count) — past its **~5-min launch deadline** (measured from
     that file's `pass_identity.dispatched_at`) →
     it **never started** (Stage 2a launch check — a reviewer hung on stdin, a bad path, a sandbox
     denial). Kill the task, re-check the command for the known launch faults (above all the quoted
     prompt-file stdin redirect), and re-dispatch the pass once into **attempt-scoped artifacts**
     (`review-<pr>-<n>.a2.*`, fresh `pass_identity` with `launch_attempt: 2` — never the dead attempt's
     files, which a surviving process could still write to); a dead `launch_attempt: 2` →
     fresh-worker fallback. A failed launch yields no verdict: it never touches `reviews_ok` and
     never bumps the row's `attempts`;
   - CI red and no fix is already in flight for that PR/SHA → **CLASSIFY the failure from the check logs
     first (Stage 2b, "Classify, then set the model class") — never dispatch a worker straight off a red
     check.** The class picks the logical model class: a **formatting/lint** failure → a scoped CI-fix
     worker in the runtime adapter's **`economy`** class, which runs a
     formatter, **reads the resulting diff**, and **escalates** anything it cannot verify; **everything
     else** — and every **escalation** — → a scoped CI-fix worker in the **`session`** class. Either way the
     resulting commit **resets the gate** (Stage 2b, "Any campaign commit to the PR head resets the gate").
     The worker's job order, the no-weakening prohibition, and the denylist live in `stage-2-ci.md` —
     follow them there; do NOT restate them here. Different PRs may fix CI concurrently within the cap.
   - CI snapshot holds a **still-RUNNING** evidence row (an evidence row that classifies `RUNNING` under
     Stage 2b CLASSIFY — never "a row that is not terminal") for a PR whose watch task has already exited →
     **relaunch the watch in this same heartbeat**. A PR with a row that can still move must never sit
     unwatched until the fallback heartbeat; the fallback lifecycle is not the mechanism. **But NEVER relaunch
     it merely because `ci == pending`** — once CI has SETTLED nothing can move, `gh pr checks --watch`
     exits in about a second, and its completion is itself a heartbeat: that is a heartbeat per second, forever
     (Stage 2b, "WATCH ONLY WHAT CAN MOVE"). A settled PR is resolved by the `settled_strikes`
     escalation, not by watching it harder. **And a row that never leaves `RUNNING` is resolved by
     RUNNING-STALL** (Stage 2b): its watch blocks forever and completes never, so the escalation lands on
     **this fallback heartbeat**, once `ci_stalled_since` has stood at the same fingerprint for the CI STALL
     CAP. **A watch is never a bound.**
   - about to dispatch content-changing work on a PR (review fix, CI fix, copilot-address,
     conflict-resolving rebase) while a review is in flight on that PR → **stop that review task
     first** (its verdict can only describe a SHA the fix is about to replace); the freed slot goes
     to the next due review.
   - mergeable **and not parked** → queue for serialized merge drain.
   Treat ~8 as a **rolling concurrency cap**, not a wave size: keep up to ~8 CI-fix subagents and ~8
   review processes in flight, refilling each free slot immediately; queue the rest. **Launch, do not
   wait — never barrier on a group of PRs before dispatching the next.**
   Allowed idle state is narrow and explicit: no PR can start a review, no CI/precondition fix is due,
   no exited watch needs relaunching, no PR is mergeable, and every remaining wait is external
   (background review/CI), a **parked** PR awaiting the user (`awaiting-user` / `awaiting-api` — idle on
   that PR is the CORRECT state, never a stall to "fix" by dispatching work), or a genuinely full cap. If the run has **no PR at all**
   and none is in flight (no-arg idle), do not spin: show the **idle prompt**
   (`run-identity-and-lease.md`, "Resolving a heartbeat", owns its wording).
### Step 4 — Merge queued PRs as a serialized drain

4. **Merge** queued PRs as a serialized drain: re-confirm one candidate against the live SHA **and
   re-check it is not parked** (the held-status guard binds the merge too — Stage 3), merge
   it, sync `<base>`, reconcile remaining candidates, and repeat while another PR is immediately
   mergeable (Stage 3).
### Step 5 — Reschedule or exit

5. **Reschedule or exit.**
   - Any non-terminal PR remains (in review, pending CI, or awaiting a user ruling on a review-finding
     standoff / API approval / precondition) →
     refresh this run's lease, then choose the runtime adapter's scheduled-heartbeat or bounded-wait
     branch. A scheduled heartbeat does not hand-assemble its callback: the **Scheduled-heartbeat host**
     step in `runtime-adapter.md` ("Background work and heartbeats") owns building it — it runs
     `heartbeat.py callback` and schedules that tool's stdout, which is why the callback carries exactly
     `--run` and `--token` and never `--new`/`#PR` or `--heartbeat-id`. A scheduler-less bounded
     wait retains the current invocation and token instead of constructing a scheduled heartbeat. Both are a
     **fallback lifecycle, not a tight poll**: background completions are the primary heartbeat. A scheduled
     heartbeat also recovers a killed/orphaned session through a later scheduled heartbeat; if a scheduler-less
     invocation is killed, durable state permits a later explicit resume (see "Resume after a killed
     session"). **Size the scheduled delay or bounded wait to the nearest stall it guards:**
     - **Any dispatched review pass still awaiting its first line of launch evidence → ~5 min:** its
       Stage 2a launch deadline is then the soonest thing that can fire, and a hung launch must not
       sit undetected for a full normal interval.
     - **A background-task review streaming its stdout → poll toward the quiet window:** it can be
       declared hung before the ~15-min cap once the stream falls quiet (`stage-2-review-gate.md`, the
       stdout-stream liveness signal), so while such a review is streaming, a shorter poll toward that
       quiet window is a real check, not a bare re-reconcile.
     - **Otherwise → ~15 min:** matching the Stage 2a meaningful-progress
       threshold — with no launch deadline pending, nothing can declare a review stalled before then, so a
       shorter interval only re-reconciles git/gh with no new signal (and pays a fresh-context cost per
       heartbeat).

     ALWAYS keep a heartbeat or bounded wait active whenever non-terminal work remains — skipping
     both means a hung or orphaned run wakes no one. **Now render the status — this happens on EVERY
     heartbeat that reschedules, never skipped, and its first and mandatory element is the ledger table
     itself.** Run
     `ledger.py --file <state.jsonl> table` and include its output verbatim, fenced, in the status
     message. **Verbatim means WHOLE** — including every `#` line it prints below the grid. The default
     view is a **filtered** one and those lines are what disclose the filtering
     (`files-and-ledger.md`, "`table` is a PROJECTION"); drop them and the user is shown a subset
     presented as the whole ledger. Never re-type, trim, or re-align it. Then one line per remaining
     wait naming what it waits on (review in flight, CI watch, parked on the user's answer). Render it
     after every ledger write during this heartbeat — the ledger was reconciled this heartbeat, so the table is the
     state the next reconcile resumes from. Then take exactly one runtime branch:
     - **Scheduled-heartbeat host:** schedule the heartbeat, render the status above, and return. The scheduled
       invocation begins again at step 1.
     - **Scheduler-less bounded-wait host:** render the same status, wait only until the first task
       completion or the nearest protected deadline, then go directly back to step 1 and reconcile.
       Repeat this status/wait/reconcile cycle while non-terminal work remains. Do **not** execute the
       scheduled-host return after the bounded wait.
   - All this run's PRs `merged` or `aborted` → **distill the run into the carryover ledger** by running
     **`carryover.py distill`** (it projects this run's own file `.gauntlet/history/<run-id>.md` from the
     terminal ledger — merged PRs, aborted PRs + why, and declined-API facts — and REFUSES a run with any
     non-terminal row or an existing file, so it distills exactly once; per-run files never
     contend, see "Fresh runs and carryover"), **release the run** (delete this run's
     `gauntlet-run-<run-id>` owner label via `gh label delete gauntlet-run-<run-id> --yes`, and release
     the lease — `lease.py … release --token <tok>`; the shared status labels stay), emit the final report, and **do not
     reschedule**. This run's loop ends. **Leave
     `<rundir>` in place** (do NOT delete it here) — its terminal `state.jsonl` is what lets a later bare
     invocation detect *this* *finished* run and take the "ask the user" branch in step 1 instead of a
     silent exit. (A stale heartbeat firing after exit harmlessly re-hits the finished-run branch via
     its `--run <run-id>`; with the lease released it reads as an un-driven finished run.)

**Idempotency is the load-bearing property.** Because every heartbeat re-derives from git/gh and launches
only work not already in flight, a relaunch after a killed session — or two completions landing close
together — cannot corrupt state or act on a stale verdict (PR-content pinning rejects stale verdicts
at the gate). The worst case is a wasted duplicate review, which is harmless: it's just another fresh,
context-isolated re-roll anyway. The agent is also single-threaded per turn, so heartbeat *decisions* never truly race — only
in-flight tasks do.

#### Resume after a killed session

**Resume after a killed session — including by a different agent instance:** in-flight background
tasks die with the session, but nothing authoritative is lost. A new invocation reconciles against
git/gh and continues — completed work is never redone (existing PRs, landed verdict files); a CI task
whose output file is missing re-launches, and a **review** with no verdict and no live task goes through
**Stage 2a active-attempt resolution** rather than a blind re-launch: read the highest-numbered launch
attempt's `pass_identity` and dispatch on `launch_attempt` alone — `1` → relaunch once as attempt `2`;
`2` → fresh-worker fallback. **The relaunch budget lives on disk, not in the session**, so it survives
the death of the agent that spent it — otherwise each new instance would rediscover a missing output
file, relaunch the same hung reviewer, die, and repeat forever.

**Every dead pass must land on exactly one of those two branches.** Do NOT gate the resume path on
launch evidence: a dead attempt `2` that *did* write a `started` line before its session died would
then satisfy neither "relaunch" (budget spent) nor "fall back" (evidence present) — no rule would fire
and the PR would stall forever, which is the very failure this feature exists to prevent. Launch
evidence answers "is this **live** process working?" and is meaningful **only** for the in-flight
~5-min launch check; once the task is gone, the only question is how much relaunch budget remains. It
binds to the run via
`--run <id>` (what every scheduled heartbeat carries, so a fresh instance adopting an orphaned run's heartbeat
just works) or, for a bare re-invocation, by discovering live runs and adopting the sole **orphaned**
one (asking among several). Adoption is gated on the **run lease**: an agent takes over only a run
whose lease is absent or stale, so it can always tell whether another agent is still driving that
ledger and never double-drives an actively-held run (see "Run identity and concurrency" and Loop
control step 1). This is how a later agent picks up exactly where a previous instance left off.
