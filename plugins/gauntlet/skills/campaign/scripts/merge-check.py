"""DECIDE whether a PR may merge — from its ledger row plus its live GitHub view. GATE MACHINERY.

It prints ONE verdict: `merge` (every precondition met) or `not-yet` with a concrete `reason`. It NEVER
merges anything, and it wires into no merge step — deciding and doing are two jobs, and this is only the
first. `gh pr merge` lives in `stage-3-merge.md`, downstream of a `merge` verdict; nothing here runs it.

WHY THIS IS A COMMAND AND NOT A TABLE A DRIVER READS BY EYE. The merge decision crosses FIVE ledger
preconditions (held, open, draft, live head == reviewed head, ci, reviews) and then TWO GitHub enums
(`.mergeable` and `.mergeStateStatus`) that answer DIFFERENT questions — `.mergeable` says the branches
CAN be combined, `.mergeStateStatus` says the merge is PERMITTED RIGHT NOW. Reading one for the other is
the miscross that once turned a BLOCKED merge into an infinite CI watch (`stage-3-merge.md`): a PR that was
`.mergeable = MERGEABLE` with a fully green rollup, blocked only because it was a draft, was mapped to
`ci = pending` and watched forever, because nothing was ever going to move. This tool is the ONE place the
two enums are crossed, so nobody does it by hand and nobody does it wrong.

`.mergeable = MERGEABLE` is NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT: it falls THROUGH to `.mergeStateStatus`, which is
the only field that yields `merge`. Both enums are mapped TOTALLY — every value GitHub's schema declares has
its own row, and a value with NO row is a WEDGE, so the catch-all PARKS it rather than guessing. The table
this implements is `references/stage-3-merge.md`'s merge-precondition table, and `doc-check` FAILS the build
if the doc and this code stop enumerating the same value sets — neither may add or drop a value alone.

    merge-check.py check --pr 31 --file <state.jsonl> [--repo owner/name] [--view-json <path>]
    merge-check.py doc-check   assert stage-3-merge.md's two enum sets equal the sets `decide` handles
    merge-check.py self-test   run every fixture (merge-check-test.py), then doc-check

The fixture suite is the SIBLING `merge-check-test.py`, this tool's EXECUTABLE CONTRACT; `self-test` loads
it by a `__file__`-relative path and FAILS LOUDLY if it is missing — a self-test that passes because it
found no tests is not a passing gate.
